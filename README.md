# COVID-19connect
"I developed the COVID-19 Connect website, a user-friendly platform that offers valuable COVID-19 information and helps users find nearby healthcare, testing, and vaccination centers. Leveraging my web development skills, I aimed to make it easy for people to access essential pandemic-related information during these challenging times."
